## Git Intro

### Version control, command line basics
I was able to Create a test project folder and initialize it as a Git repository(geoflexwebsite) using the terminal, tracked changes by adding some text files, made edits, and committed updates with clear messages.

### Cloud repo management
- Created a new branch (feature1), made changes on it, then switched back to master and merge the branch. Resolved merge conflicts.
- Pushed my project to GitHub by creating a remote repository, linked it to my local repo, and pushed my commits.
- Cloned my GitHub repo into a new folder and simulated pulling code from a remote source.

### Collaboration
- Forked sshuair's repository--https://github.com/beccanj/awesome-gis, made a change, pushed to my fork(software1), and opened a pull request. Also, commented on his PR.
